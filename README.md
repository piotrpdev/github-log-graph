## Usage

### Development

Just run and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
npm run build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

### Issues

#### Husky

If pre-commit hooks are not working be sure that you have installed husky: `husky install`.

By default this command should be triggered after yarn/npm deps are installed.
